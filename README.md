# Dog-Bite-Analysis
üîç **Project Highlights:**

1. **Data Collection:** I gathered data on thousands of dog bite incidents, including information on the date, location, dog breed, and other relevant details.

2. **Data Cleaning and Imputation:** Preparing the data was a crucial step. I addressed missing values, corrected data types, and imputed information where necessary.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** EDA revealed fascinating insights, including the most common breeds involved, incident trends over time, and regional hotspots.

4. **Geospatial Analysis:** I used geospatial data to create an interactive map, helping us visualize incident density across different boroughs.

5. **Time Trends Analysis:** By studying incident trends by day, month, and day of the week, I identified temporal patterns.

6. **Correlation Analysis:** I explored relationships within the dataset, uncovering factors that may contribute to incidents.


7. üßê **Key Takeaways:**

                  - Understanding when and where incidents are likely to occur can help allocate resources effectively.
                  - Breed-specific insights can inform targeted interventions and policies.
                  - Long-term trends can guide public awareness campaigns and educational efforts.
